- 👋 Hi, I’m @carolinedelery
- 👀 I’m interested in cooking, discovering new quick and healthy recipes, walking around town with my dog and back-to-school survival tips!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding in RStudio.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on github, if I ever figure out how it works!
- 📫 You can reach me here. Or can you? So many questions, so few answers.
